# SMAP Data Access (NSIDC)

SMAP data is hosted at the NSIDC DAAC (https://nsidc.org/data/smap). Many SMAP products require Earthdata login or are accessible via NSIDC APIs. For convenience, use the NSIDC API or Earthdata Login to programmatically fetch SMAP surface soil moisture products for your bounding box and date range.
Refer to: https://nsidc.org/data/smap for product list and access instructions.
